    productivity = [initial_productivity]
    for n in range(1, terms):
        productivity.append(productivity[-1] * (1 + growth_rate))
    return productivity

# Example: Initial productivity = 80%, growth rate = 2% per quarter, 12 quarters

    """
    clarity = signal
    for n in range(1, terms):
        clarity += (noise**n) / np.math.factorial(n)
    return clarity

# Example: Signal = 0.8, Noise = 0.2, 5 terms
signal_clarity = power_series_signal(0.8, 0.2, 5)
print("Signal Clarity:", signal_clarity)
```

#### **3. Taylor Series: Wind Turbine Energy Output**
**Industry Relevance**: Predict energy output under varying wind conditions.

```python

    """
    output = base_output
    for n in range(1, terms):
        output += ((-elasticity)**n) / np.math.factorial(n) * (wind_speed_variation**n)
    return output

# Example: Base output = 300 kWh, variation = 10%, elasticity = 1.5, 5 terms
predicted_output = taylor_wind_energy(300, 0.1, 1.5, 5)
print("Predicted Energy Output:", predicted_output)
```

    """
    Compute loan amortization schedule using a numerical series approach.
    """
    schedule = []
    for n in range(1, periods + 1):
        payment = (principal * rate) / (1 - (1 + rate)**-periods)
        schedule.append(payment)
    return schedule

# Example: Loan $100,000, interest rate 5% per year, 20 years
amortization = amortization_schedule(100000, 0.05, 20)
print("Amortization Schedule:", amortization)
```

#### **5. Fourier Series: Seasonal Traffic Forecasting**
**Industry Relevance**: Optimize transportation logistics by predicting peak traffic times.

```python
def fourier_traffic(t, terms):
    """
    Forecast traffic patterns using Fourier series.
    """
    traffic = 0
    for n in range(1, terms + 1):
        traffic += (1 / n) * np.sin(2 * np.pi * n * t)
    return traffic

# Example: Traffic patterns over a day (24 hours)
time = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
traffic_forecast = fourier_traffic(time, 10)

plt.plot(time, traffic_forecast)
plt.title("Traffic Pattern Forecast")
plt.xlabel("Time (Hours)")
plt.ylabel("Traffic Index")
plt.show()
```

#### **6. Sequences of Real Numbers: Inventory Management**
**Industry Relevance**: Predict inventory needs for e-commerce platforms.

```python
def inventory_sequence(init_stock, restock_rate, max_capacity, periods):
    """
    Simulate inventory levels using a logistic growth model.
    """
    sequence = [init_stock]
    for _ in range(periods - 1):
        next_stock = sequence[-1] + restock_rate * (max_capacity - sequence[-1])
        sequence.append(next_stock)
    return sequence

# Example: Initial stock = 500, restock rate = 10%, max capacity = 2000, 12 months
inventory_levels = inventory_sequence(500, 0.1, 2000, 12)
print("Inventory Levels:", inventory_levels)
```
