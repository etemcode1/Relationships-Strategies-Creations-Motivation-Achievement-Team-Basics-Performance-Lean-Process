### Code Examples

#### 1. **Sentiment Analysis for Positive Reinforcement**

This code uses a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to evaluate messages and feedback in a relationship, emphasizing positive communication.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Ensure nltk resources are downloaded
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

def analyze_sentiment(messages):
    """Analyze the sentiment of messages to encourage positive interactions."""
    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    positive_messages = []

    for message in messages:
        score = sia.polarity_scores(message)
        if score['compound'] > 0.1:  # Positive sentiment threshold
            positive_messages.append(message)

    return positive_messages

# Example usage
messages = [
    "I really appreciate everything you do!",
    "You never listen to me.",
    "I'm so proud of us for working together."
]
positive_feedback = analyze_sentiment(messages)
print("Positive Messages:\n", positive_feedback)
```

#### 2. **Attention Mechanism to Focus on Positive Events**

Using attention networks, this example emphasizes significant positive experiences in the relationship, helping to keep those memories fresh.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class AttentionNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim):
        super(AttentionNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.attention = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.context_vector = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        attention_scores = self.attention(x)
        attention_weights = torch.softmax(self.context_vector(attention_scores), dim=1)
        context_vector = torch.bmm(attention_weights.transpose(1, 2), x.unsqueeze(0))
        return context_vector.squeeze(0)

# Example usage
input_dim = 5  # Example input dimension
hidden_dim = 3  # Attention hidden dimension
attention_model = AttentionNetwork(input_dim, hidden_dim)

# Sample positive events (feature vectors)
positive_events = torch.randn(10, input_dim)  # 10 events with 5 features each
context = attention_model(positive_events)
print("Context Vector:\n", context)
```

#### 3. **Recommendation System for Positive Activities**

This code creates a simple recommendation engine to suggest activities that strengthen relationships, using collaborative filtering.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def recommend_activities(user_preferences, all_activities):
    """Recommend activities based on user preferences using cosine similarity."""
    similarity = cosine_similarity(user_preferences)
    recommended_indices = similarity.argsort()[:, -3:]  # Top 3 recommendations

    recommendations = []
    for index in recommended_indices:
        recommendations.append(all_activities[index])

    return recommendations

# Example usage
user_preferences = pd.DataFrame({
    'Activity': ['Movie', 'Dinner', 'Hiking', 'Cooking', 'Dance Class'],
    'Rating': [5, 4, 3, 5, 2]
}).set_index('Activity')

all_activities = ['Movie', 'Dinner', 'Hiking', 'Cooking', 'Dance Class', 'Art Class', 'Yoga']
recommended_activities = recommend_activities(user_preferences.values, all_activities)
print("Recommended Activities:\n", recommended_activities)
```

#### 4. **Emotion Recognition for Enhancing Communication**

This code leverages deep learning to recognize emotions from text input, enhancing understanding and empathy in communication.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

def recognize_emotion(text):
    """Use a transformer model to recognize emotions in text."""
    emotion_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
    emotions = emotion_pipeline(text)
    return emotions

# Example usage
text_input = "I feel so happy when I'm with you!"
detected_emotions = recognize_emotion(text_input)
print("Detected Emotions:\n", detected_emotions)
```

#### 5. **Mindfulness and Reflection Chatbot**

This simple chatbot encourages mindfulness and reflection, using NLP to engage users in meaningful conversations.

```python
import random

responses = [
    "What are you grateful for today?",
    "How did you show love to someone this week?",
    "What challenges did you overcome recently?"
]

def mindfulness_chatbot():
    """Engage the user in reflective conversation."""
    print("Mindfulness Chatbot: Let's reflect!")
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ['exit', 'quit']:
            break
        print("Mindfulness Chatbot:", random.choice(responses))

# Example usage (uncomment to run)
# mindfulness_chatbot()
```

#### 6. **Behavior Tracking for Relationship Insights**

This code tracks and visualizes relationship metrics over time, helping couples to see their growth and areas for improvement.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_relationship_metrics(metrics):
    """Plot metrics related to the relationship over time."""
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    for metric, values in metrics.items():
        plt.plot(values, label=metric)

    plt.title('Relationship Growth Over Time')
    plt.xlabel('Time')
    plt.ylabel('Metric Value')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid()
    plt.show()

# Example usage
relationship_metrics = {
    'Communication': [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    'Quality Time': [3, 5, 7, 8, 10],
    'Emotional Connection': [4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
}
plot_relationship_metrics(relationship_metrics)
```

#### 7. **Personalized Affirmation Generator**

This code generates personalized affirmations to reinforce positive thoughts and feelings in a relationship.

```python
import random

def generate_affirmation(partner_name):
    """Generate a personalized affirmation for a partner."""
    affirmations = [
        f"You are amazing, {partner_name}!",
        f"I'm so grateful to have you in my life, {partner_name}.",
        f"You make every day better, {partner_name}!"
    ]
    return random.choice(affirmations)

# Example usage
partner_name = "Alex"
personalized_affirmation = generate_affirmation(partner_name)
print("Personalized Affirmation:\n", personalized_affirmation)
```

### Summary

These code examples provide a multifaceted approach to building applications that not only help to refocus attention away from negative influences like cyberstalkers but also promote healthier and more fulfilling relationships. By utilizing deep learning techniques and AI principles, these applications encourage positive interactions, enhance emotional understanding, and foster a supportive environment for love and growth.
