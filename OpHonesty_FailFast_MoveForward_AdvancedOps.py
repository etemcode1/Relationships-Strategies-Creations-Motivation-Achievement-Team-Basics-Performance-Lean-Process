### 1. **Dynamic Error Detection & Feedback Loop**
   - **Objective**: Instantly recognize and log errors during development to reinforce transparency and support fast failure recovery.
   - **Key Elements**: Dynamic data validation, error categorization, automated feedback loop.

   ```python
   def validate_input(data, expected_type):
       try:
           assert isinstance(data, expected_type), "Data type mismatch!"
           return True
       except AssertionError as e:
           log_error(f"Validation error: {str(e)}")
           return False

   def log_error(message):
       # Record error and trigger feedback loop for corrections
       with open("error_log.txt", "a") as log_file:
           log_file.write(f"{datetime.now()}: {message}\n")
       trigger_feedback_loop(message)

   def trigger_feedback_loop(error_message):
       # Notify responsible teams for immediate action
       print(f"Error detected: {error_message}. Team notified for correction.")
       # Additional automated correction systems can be built here
   ```

### 2. **Data-Driven Decision Matrix for Goal Setting**
   - **Objective**: Prioritize tasks based on real-time data analytics to meet short, mid-range, and long-term objectives.
   - **Key Elements**: Data analytics, prioritization algorithm, goal alignment.

   ```python
   def prioritize_tasks(task_list, data):
       # Analyze data to rank tasks by short, mid, long-term goal alignment
       def score_task(task):
           return (data['impact'][task] * 0.5 + data['urgency'][task] * 0.3 + data['feasibility'][task] * 0.2)

       ranked_tasks = sorted(task_list, key=lambda task: score_task(task), reverse=True)
       return ranked_tasks

   task_list = ["Prototype Testing", "Market Analysis", "Hiring Strategy"]
   data = {
       'impact': {"Prototype Testing": 9, "Market Analysis": 7, "Hiring Strategy": 6},
       'urgency': {"Prototype Testing": 8, "Market Analysis": 6, "Hiring Strategy": 9},
       'feasibility': {"Prototype Testing": 7, "Market Analysis": 8, "Hiring Strategy": 5}
   }

   ranked = prioritize_tasks(task_list, data)
   print("Task priority:", ranked)
   ```

   ```python
   class Prototype:
       def __init__(self, version):
           self.version = version
           self.test_results = {}

       def run_tests(self):
           # Fail-fast approach with predefined test cases
           self.test_results = {"feature_1": self.test_feature_1(),
                                "feature_2": self.test_feature_2()}
           if any(result is False for result in self.test_results.values()):
               self.fail_fast()

       def test_feature_1(self):
           # Example test logic
           return True  # Test passed

       def test_feature_2(self):
           # Example test logic
           return False  # Test failed (intentional)

       def fail_fast(self):
           print(f"Prototype v{self.version} failed! Test results: {self.test_results}")
           # Abort or adjust logic to move forward

   proto = Prototype(version=1.0)
   proto.run_tests()
   ```

### 4. **Goal Decomposition with Real-Time Adjustment**
   - **Objective**: Adapt short and long-term goals based on operational feedback and complex system dynamics.
   - **Key Elements**: Goal decomposition, real-time adjustment, iterative improvement.

   ```python
   goals = {
       "short_term": {"Develop MVP": 100, "Client Feedback": 50},
       "mid_term": {"Scale Product": 200, "Enter New Market": 150},
       "long_term": {"Global Expansion": 500, "IPO": 1000}
   }

   def adjust_goals(feedback_data):
       for goal, progress in feedback_data.items():
           if goal in goals['short_term']:
               goals['short_term'][goal] += progress
           elif goal in goals['mid_term']:
               goals['mid_term'][goal] += progress
           elif goal in goals['long_term']:
               goals['long_term'][goal] += progress

       print("Adjusted goals:", goals)

   feedback_data = {"Develop MVP": -10, "Global Expansion": 20}
   adjust_goals(feedback_data)
   ```

       "times_adjusted_strategy": 0
   }

   def update_dashboard(metric, value):

           honesty_metrics[metric] += value
           print(f"Dashboard updated: {metric} -> {honesty_metrics[metric]}")

   resources = {"budget": 100000, "manpower": 50}

   def allocate_resources(project, viability_score):
       if viability_score < 5:
           print(f"Project {project} deemed non-viable, resources not allocated.")
       else:
           allocated_budget = resources["budget"] * (viability_score / 10)
           allocated_manpower = resources["manpower"] * (viability_score / 10)
           print(f"Allocating ${allocated_budget} and {allocated_manpower} people to {project}.")

   allocate_resources("Project Phoenix", viability_score=8)
   ```

   def reinforce_behavior(behavior, value):
       if behavior in team_behavior:
           team_behavior[behavior] += value
           print(f"Reinforcing {behavior}: {team_behavior[behavior]}")
           if team_behavior[behavior] >= 10:
               print(f"Excellent {behavior} demonstrated. Reward triggered!")

   reinforce_behavior("honesty", 2)
   ```
