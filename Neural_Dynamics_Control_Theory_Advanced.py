   from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp

   def cost_function(W, X, y_true):
       predictions = X.dot(W)
       return np.linalg.norm(predictions - y_true)**2

   def neural_dynamics(t, W, X, y_true):
       return -2 * X.T.dot(X.dot(W) - y_true)

   def optimal_control_pontryagin(X, y_true, W0, t_span):
       sol = solve_ivp(neural_dynamics, t_span, W0, args=(X, y_true), method='RK45')
       return sol.y[:, -1]

   # Example with synthetic data
   X = np.random.randn(100, 50)  # 100 samples, 50 features
   y_true = np.random.randn(100)  # synthetic target
   W0 = np.random.randn(50)  # initial weights
   t_span = [0, 10]
   optimal_W = optimal_control_pontryagin(X, y_true, W0, t_span)
   print(f"Optimal weights: {optimal_W}")
