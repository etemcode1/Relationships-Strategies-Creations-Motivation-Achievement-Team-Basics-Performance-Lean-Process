To address fault tolerance across government branches, SMBs, engineering and management teams, sales and marketing, and objective optimization, here are 10 advanced code examples. These examples incorporate structured fault-tolerant principles using error handling, redundancy, logging, and resource management to safeguard against failures, especially in high-stakes or high-load scenarios. This ensures resilience and continuity across key organizational functions.

### Code Examples

1. **Redundant Data Storage for Fault Tolerance in Government Record-Keeping**  
   This example demonstrates redundant storage across multiple data centers to ensure data is not lost if one center fails, critical for maintaining the continuity of government records.

   ```python
   import boto3

   def store_data_redundantly(data, file_id):
       s3_client1 = boto3.client('s3', region_name='us-east-1')
       s3_client2 = boto3.client('s3', region_name='us-west-2')
       try:
           s3_client1.put_object(Bucket='gov-storage-east', Key=file_id, Body=data)
           s3_client2.put_object(Bucket='gov-storage-west', Key=file_id, Body=data)
           return "Data stored redundantly."
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Error in storage: {e}")
           return "Storage failed."

   store_data_redundantly("critical_document", "doc123")
   ```

2. **Resilient API Design for SMBs**  
   In this example, a retry mechanism is used to handle transient errors in SMB APIs, ensuring fault tolerance for web services under unpredictable network conditions.

   ```python
   import requests
   import time

   def get_data_with_retries(url, retries=3):
       for attempt in range(retries):
           try:
               response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
               response.raise_for_status()
               return response.json()
           except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
               print(f"Attempt {attempt+1} failed: {e}")
               time.sleep(2)  # Wait before retrying
       return "Failed to retrieve data after retries."

   result = get_data_with_retries("https://api.smbservice.com/data")
   ```

3. **Load Balancing for Engineering Team Resources**  
   This example showcases a load balancer that directs requests to different servers, reducing overload on any single resource, which is essential for maintaining productivity in engineering teams.

   ```python
   from random import choice

   servers = ["server1", "server2", "server3"]

   def load_balance_request():
       selected_server = choice(servers)
       print(f"Request directed to: {selected_server}")
       # Simulate sending request to selected server
       return selected_server

   for _ in range(10):
       load_balance_request()
   ```

4. **Exception Handling for Management Decision Analysis**  
   This code illustrates structured exception handling, ensuring that critical analysis continues even if certain inputs fail, vital for management decision-making under uncertain data quality.

   ```python
   def perform_analysis(data):
       try:
           result = sum(data) / len(data)
           return result
       except ZeroDivisionError:
           return "No data to analyze."
       except Exception as e:
           return f"Unexpected error: {e}"

   analysis_result = perform_analysis([10, 20, 30, 0])
   ```

5. **Circuit Breaker Pattern for Sales API Calls**  
   The circuit breaker prevents repeated requests to a failing service in a sales environment, improving response times by halting requests until the service recovers.

   ```python
   class CircuitBreaker:
       def __init__(self, failure_threshold, recovery_time):
           self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
           self.failures = 0
           self.recovery_time = recovery_time
           self.last_failure_time = None

       def call_service(self, service_call):
           if self.failures >= self.failure_threshold:
               print("Circuit open; request blocked.")
               return None
           try:
               return service_call()
           except Exception:
               self.failures += 1
               self.last_failure_time = time.time()
               print("Service failed; circuit will remain open.")
               return None

   def sales_api():
       # Mock sales API call
       raise ValueError("Sales API temporarily down")

   cb = CircuitBreaker(3, 60)
   cb.call_service(sales_api)
   ```

6. **Fallback Mechanism for Marketing Campaigns**  
   This example uses fallback options for selecting alternative marketing channels when a primary channel fails, ensuring that campaigns maintain reach.

   ```python
   def select_marketing_channel(channel_list):
       for channel in channel_list:
           try:
               print(f"Attempting to use {channel}")
               # Simulated channel operation
               if channel == "Email":  # Simulate Email channel failure
                   raise ConnectionError("Email server not responding.")
               return f"Channel {channel} selected."
           except ConnectionError as e:
               print(f"Error with {channel}: {e}")
       return "All channels failed."

   result = select_marketing_channel(["Email", "Social Media", "SMS"])
   ```

7. **Resource Quota Management for Objective Optimization**  
   Resource quotas help prevent excessive resource consumption in optimization tasks, which ensures efficient and stable execution for resource-heavy processes.

   ```python
   def optimize_resource_quota(task, max_resources):
       resources_used = 0
       while resources_used < max_resources:
           try:
               resources_used += task()
               print(f"Resources used: {resources_used}")
           except Exception:
               break
       print("Optimization complete or resource limit reached.")

   optimize_resource_quota(lambda: 10, 100)
   ```

8. **Transaction Rollback for Engineering Process Automation**  
   This code demonstrates a transaction rollback, which is key for ensuring that if one part of an engineering process fails, previous steps are reverted to maintain system consistency.

   ```python
   def transaction():
       try:
           print("Starting transaction...")
           # Simulate steps in transaction
           raise Exception("Step 2 failed!")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Transaction error: {e}")
           print("Rolling back previous steps.")

   transaction()
   ```

9. **Health Check System for Management Infrastructure**  
   Routine health checks ensure management systems run smoothly by identifying failing components and flagging them for maintenance, which reduces downtime and preserves business continuity.

   ```python
   def health_check(services):
       failed_services = []
       for service in services:
           try:
               print(f"Checking {service}")
               if service == "DB":  # Simulated failure
                   raise TimeoutError("Database timeout.")
               print(f"{service} OK")
           except TimeoutError as e:
               failed_services.append(service)
               print(f"{service} failed: {e}")
       return failed_services

   services = ["API", "DB", "Cache"]
   health_check(services)
   ```

10. **Predictive Maintenance Model for Sales and Marketing Infrastructure**  
   Predictive maintenance using failure prediction for servers supports continuity, allowing sales and marketing teams to avoid system downtimes, ensuring uninterrupted access to critical resources.

   ```python
   import numpy as np

   def predictive_maintenance_model(uptime_data):
       threshold = np.mean(uptime_data) - np.std(uptime_data)
       predicted_failures = [time for time in uptime_data if time < threshold]
       return predicted_failures

   uptime_data = [98, 96, 97, 80, 95, 90, 85, 95, 99, 88]
   failures = predictive_maintenance_model(uptime_data)
   print("Predicted failures:", failures)
   ```
