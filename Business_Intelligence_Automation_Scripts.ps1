### 1. **Automated Data Extraction from Multiple Data Sources**

This script extracts data from various databases (SQL Server, Oracle, and CSV files) and consolidates it into a single dataset for analysis.

```powershell
# SQL Server Connection
$SqlServerConn = "Server=SQLServer;Database=SalesDB;User ID=sa;Password=your_password;"
$SqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM SalesData WHERE SaleDate >= GETDATE()-30"

# Extract SQL Data
$SqlData = Invoke-Sqlcmd -ConnectionString $SqlServerConn -Query $SqlQuery

# Oracle Database Connection
$OracleConn = "Data Source=OracleDB;User ID=user;Password=password;"
$OracleQuery = "SELECT * FROM MarketingData WHERE Date >= SYSDATE-30"

# Extract Oracle Data
$OracleData = Invoke-Sqlcmd -ConnectionString $OracleConn -Query $OracleQuery

# CSV File Data Extraction
$CsvData = Import-Csv "C:\Data\FinancialData.csv"

# Merge all data into a single dataset
$ConsolidatedData = $SqlData + $OracleData + $CsvData
$ConsolidatedData | Export-Csv "C:\ConsolidatedData\BusinessData.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

### Wise Evidence and Robust Value:
Automating data extraction from multiple sources allows for more comprehensive business analysis. This script reduces manual effort, ensuring data is always up to date. It provides better, faster decision-making by consolidating data from across the organization.

### 2. **Automated KPI Calculation and Reporting**

This script calculates business Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as sales growth, customer acquisition rate, and profitability. It then generates a report for management.

```powershell
# Load the consolidated data
$Data = Import-Csv "C:\ConsolidatedData\BusinessData.csv"

# Calculate KPIs
$TotalSales = ($Data | Measure-Object Sales -Sum).Sum
$SalesGrowth = (($TotalSales - $PreviousMonthSales) / $PreviousMonthSales) * 100
$CustomerAcquisition = ($Data | Where-Object { $_.AcquiredCustomer -eq "Yes" }).Count
$Profitability = ($TotalSales - ($Data | Measure-Object Costs -Sum).Sum) / $TotalSales

# Generate a KPI report
$KPIReport = @{
    "TotalSales" = $TotalSales;
    "SalesGrowth" = "{0:N2}%" -f $SalesGrowth;
    "CustomerAcquisitionRate" = $CustomerAcquisition;
    "Profitability" = "{0:P2}" -f $Profitability
}

$KPIReport | Export-Csv "C:\Reports\KPI_Report.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

### Wise Evidence and Robust Value:
Automating KPI calculations ensures accuracy and efficiency, empowering leaders to make data-driven decisions. This script supports real-time performance tracking and provides valuable insights for business strategy adjustments.

### 3. **Automated Power BI Data Refresh**

This script uses PowerShell to trigger a refresh of Power BI datasets, ensuring that dashboards are always updated with the latest business data.

```powershell
# Power BI API connection
$powerBIGroupId = "your-group-id"
$datasetId = "your-dataset-id"
$accessToken = "your-access-token"

# Trigger dataset refresh
$uri = "https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/$powerBIGroupId/datasets/$datasetId/refreshes"
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Post -Headers @{Authorization = "Bearer $accessToken"}

Write-Output "Power BI dataset refresh triggered successfully."
```

### Wise Evidence and Robust Value:
This script automates the update of Power BI dashboards, ensuring that decision-makers always have access to the latest data. The automation streamlines data flows, reducing manual intervention and maintaining real-time insights into business metrics.

### 4. **Automated Trend Analysis for Predictive Insights**

This script performs a trend analysis by analyzing historical sales data and uses linear regression to forecast future sales. Itâ€™s an automated predictive tool for business intelligence.

```powershell
# Load historical sales data
$Data = Import-Csv "C:\Data\HistoricalSalesData.csv"

# Extract sales values and dates
$Sales = $Data | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Sales
$Dates = $Data | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Date

# Perform linear regression to identify sales trend
$Count = $Sales.Count
$SumX = 0..($Count-1) | Measure-Object -Sum
$SumY = ($Sales | Measure-Object -Sum).Sum
$SumXY = 0..($Count-1) | ForEach-Object { $Sales[$_] * $_ } | Measure-Object -Sum
$SumX2 = (0..($Count-1) | ForEach-Object { $_ * $_ }) | Measure-Object -Sum

# Calculate slope and intercept
$m = ($Count * $SumXY.Sum - $SumX.Sum * $SumY) / ($Count * $SumX2.Sum - $SumX.Sum * $SumX.Sum)
$b = ($SumY - $m * $SumX.Sum) / $Count

# Forecast next 30 days
$Forecast = @()
for ($i = $Count; $i -lt $Count + 30; $i++) {
    $Forecast += [pscustomobject]@{ Date = (Get-Date).AddDays($i); ForecastedSales = $m * $i + $b }
}

# Output forecast
$Forecast | Export-Csv "C:\Reports\SalesForecast.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

### Wise Evidence and Robust Value:
By automating trend analysis and predictive forecasting, this script enables businesses to anticipate future performance and adjust strategies accordingly. It delivers data-driven forecasts that improve resource planning and market readiness.

### 5. **Automated Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing**

This script automatically segments customers based on their purchase behavior, enabling targeted marketing strategies. It uses clustering techniques to identify high-value customers.

```powershell
# Load customer data
$CustomerData = Import-Csv "C:\Data\CustomerData.csv"

# Define customer segments based on purchase behavior
$HighValueCustomers = $CustomerData | Where-Object { $_.TotalPurchases -gt 10000 }
$MidValueCustomers = $CustomerData | Where-Object { $_.TotalPurchases -le 10000 -and $_.TotalPurchases -gt 5000 }
$LowValueCustomers = $CustomerData | Where-Object { $_.TotalPurchases -le 5000 }

# Output segmented data
$HighValueCustomers | Export-Csv "C:\Segments\HighValueCustomers.csv" -NoTypeInformation
$MidValueCustomers | Export-Csv "C:\Segments\MidValueCustomers.csv" -NoTypeInformation
$LowValueCustomers | Export-Csv "C:\Segments\LowValueCustomers.csv" -NoTypeInformation

Write-Output "Customer segmentation completed successfully."
```

### Wise Evidence and Robust Value:
This script automatically segments customers into different value tiers, facilitating targeted marketing campaigns and personalized customer outreach. It boosts marketing efficiency by focusing efforts on the most valuable segments.
