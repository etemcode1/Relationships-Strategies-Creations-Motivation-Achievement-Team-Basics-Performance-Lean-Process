Here are seven advanced code examples for *High-Level Parallel Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with Algorithmic Skeletons*, designed with a focus on brilliant reasoning, robust value, and economic success:

### 1. **Parallel Initialization of Ants using Farm Skeleton**
   *This example demonstrates how to initialize the ants in parallel using a farm skeleton. Each worker generates an individual ant, reducing the total setup time.*
   ```python
   def parallel_ant_initialization(num_ants, init_func):
       from multiprocessing import Pool
       with Pool() as pool:
           ants = pool.map(init_func, range(num_ants))
       return ants
   ```
   *Brilliant Reasoning:* Farm skeleton reduces overhead in population initialization.
   *Economic Success:* Speeds up the start of ACO, minimizing delay and resource consumption.

### 2. **Load-Balanced Pheromone Update with Pipeline Skeleton**
   *Using a pipeline skeleton, this example updates the pheromone levels in a staggered manner to balance computation between nodes.*
   ```python
   def pheromone_update_pipeline(pipeline_data):
       for stage in pipeline_data:
           process_stage(stage)
   ```
   *Robust Value:* Ensures smooth data flow without bottlenecks, improving scalability.
   *Amazing Benefit:* Distributes workloads effectively, reducing computational costs.

### 3. **Search Space Exploration via Parallel Reduce Skeleton**
   *This example uses a parallel reduce skeleton to aggregate and combine the best paths found by individual ants in a parallel manner.*
   ```python
   def find_best_solution(ant_paths):
       from functools import reduce
       best_path = reduce(lambda a, b: a if a.cost < b.cost else b, ant_paths)
       return best_path
   ```
   *Brilliant Reasoning:* A reduce skeleton efficiently combines results from parallel workers.
   *Economic Success:* Achieves faster convergence to optimal solutions, saving time and computational expense.

### 4. **Parallel Distance Calculation with Map Skeleton**
   *This code computes distances between nodes using a parallel map skeleton, allowing multiple ants to calculate their tours simultaneously.*
   ```python
   def calculate_distances(ants, distance_func):
       from multiprocessing import Pool
       with Pool() as pool:
           distances = pool.map(distance_func, ants)
       return distances
   ```
   *Robust Value:* Reduces the time complexity of distance calculations, allowing more iterations in less time.
   *Amazing Benefit:* Accelerates the overall ACO process by speeding up a major bottleneck.

### 5. **Parallelized Solution Evaluation using Task Pool Skeleton**
   *Here, a task pool skeleton ensures the workload is dynamically distributed, allowing efficient evaluation of multiple ant solutions in parallel.*
   ```python
   def evaluate_solutions(ants, eval_func):
       from multiprocessing import Pool
       with Pool() as pool:
           scores = pool.map(eval_func, ants)
       return scores
   ```
   *Brilliant Reasoning:* Task pool dynamically assigns tasks based on resource availability, preventing idle processors.
   *Economic Success:* Maximizes hardware utilization, cutting down on infrastructure costs.

### 6. **Pheromone Evaporation Strategy with Recursive Skeleton**
   *This code implements pheromone evaporation recursively, allowing it to propagate through different levels of nodes in parallel.*
   ```python
   def recursive_pheromone_evaporation(pheromone_map, decay_factor):
       if len(pheromone_map) == 0:
           return
       for pheromone in pheromone_map:
           pheromone *= decay_factor
       recursive_pheromone_evaporation(pheromone_map[:-1], decay_factor)
   ```
   *Robust Value:* Recursive skeleton optimizes pheromone update over large solution spaces.
   *Amazing Benefit:* Reduces memory and computational load during large-scale optimization.

### 7. **Parallelized Solution Construction via Divide-and-Conquer Skeleton**
   *This example uses a divide-and-conquer skeleton to split the solution space and allow parallel construction of ant tours.*
   ```python
   def construct_solutions(ants, split_func, merge_func):
       if len(ants) <= 1:
           return ants
       mid = len(ants) // 2
       left = construct_solutions(ants[:mid], split_func, merge_func)
       right = construct_solutions(ants[mid:], split_func, merge_func)
       return merge_func(left, right)
   ```
   *Brilliant Reasoning:* Divide-and-conquer splits the problem into manageable chunks, enabling parallel solution generation.
   *Economic Success:* Ensures that larger problems are solvable efficiently, even with limited resources.
