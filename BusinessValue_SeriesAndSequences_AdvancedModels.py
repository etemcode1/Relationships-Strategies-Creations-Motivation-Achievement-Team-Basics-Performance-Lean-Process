### **1. Numerical Series: Modeling Revenue Growth**
**Use Case**: Predict cumulative revenue over time for a business with compounding growth.
```python
import numpy as np

def numerical_series(revenue, growth_rate, terms):
    """
    Compute the cumulative revenue series over time with compounding growth.
    """
    cumulative_revenue = [revenue]
    for n in range(1, terms):
        cumulative_revenue.append(cumulative_revenue[-1] * (1 + growth_rate))
    return cumulative_revenue

# Example: Initial revenue $1000, growth rate 5% per term, for 10 terms
revenue_series = numerical_series(1000, 0.05, 10)
print("Cumulative Revenue:", revenue_series)
```

### **2. Power Series: Pricing Stock Options**
**Use Case**: Approximate the value of European call options using a power series expansion.
```python
def power_series_option_price(S, K, r, t, sigma, terms):
    """
    Approximate the price of a European call option using a power series.
    """
    d1 = (np.log(S / K) + (r + sigma**2 / 2) * t) / (sigma * np.sqrt(t))
    option_price = 0
    factorial = 1
    for n in range(terms):
        factorial *= max(1, n)  # Compute factorial iteratively
        option_price += (d1**n) / factorial
    return option_price * np.exp(-r * t)

# Example: Stock price $50, strike price $45, risk-free rate 2%, time 1 year, volatility 20%
print("Option Price:", power_series_option_price(50, 45, 0.02, 1, 0.2, 10))
```

### **3. Taylor Series: Predicting Product Demand**
**Use Case**: Use a Taylor expansion to approximate product demand as a function of price changes.
```python
def taylor_expansion(price, base_demand, elasticity, terms):
    """
    Approximate product demand based on price elasticity using a Taylor series.
    """
    demand = base_demand
    for n in range(1, terms):
        demand += ((-elasticity) ** n) / np.math.factorial(n) * (price - 1) ** n
    return demand

# Example: Base demand = 1000 units, elasticity = 1.2, price = $1.05, 5 terms
print("Predicted Demand:", taylor_expansion(1.05, 1000, 1.2, 5))
```

### **4. Solved Exercises: Evaluating Compound Interest**
**Use Case**: Calculate cumulative compound interest for business investment decisions.
```python
def compound_interest(principal, rate, times_compounded, years):
    """
    Calculate compound interest using a numerical series formula.
    """
    return principal * (1 + rate / times_compounded) ** (times_compounded * years)

# Example: Principal $10,000, annual rate 5%, compounded monthly for 3 years
print("Total Investment:", compound_interest(10000, 0.05, 12, 3))
```

### **5. Fourier Series: Analyzing Business Cycles**
**Use Case**: Model periodic fluctuations in sales or market trends using Fourier series.
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def fourier_series(t, terms):
    """
    Approximate a periodic function (e.g., sales cycles) using Fourier series.
    """
    approximation = 0
    for n in range(1, terms + 1):
        approximation += (1 / n) * np.sin(2 * np.pi * n * t)
    return approximation

# Example: Sales cycle over 12 months
time = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
sales_cycle = fourier_series(time, 5)

plt.plot(time, sales_cycle)
plt.title("Modeled Sales Cycle")
plt.xlabel("Time (Months)")
plt.ylabel("Sales Index")
plt.show()
```

### **6. Sequences of Real Numbers: Logistic Growth Model**
**Use Case**: Forecast customer acquisition growth using a logistic sequence.
```python
def logistic_growth(init_value, rate, capacity, terms):
    """
    Simulate customer growth using a logistic model.
    """
    sequence = [init_value]
    for _ in range(terms - 1):
        next_value = sequence[-1] + rate * sequence[-1] * (1 - sequence[-1] / capacity)
        sequence.append(next_value)
    return sequence

# Example: Initial customers = 50, growth rate = 0.1, capacity = 1000, 15 terms
growth = logistic_growth(50, 0.1, 1000, 15)
print("Customer Growth Sequence:", growth)
```

### **7. Maclaurin Series: Predicting Cash Flow**
**Use Case**: Approximate cash flow growth using a Maclaurin expansion.
```python
def maclaurin_series(cash_flow, growth_rate, terms):
    """
    Predict future cash flows using a Maclaurin series.
    """
    prediction = cash_flow
    for n in range(1, terms):
        prediction += (growth_rate**n) / np.math.factorial(n) * cash_flow
    return prediction

# Example: Initial cash flow $10,000, growth rate 5%, 10 terms
print("Predicted Cash Flow:", maclaurin_series(10000, 0.05, 10))
```

### **8. Absolute Convergence: Risk Analysis in Investment Portfolios**
**Use Case**: Analyze the stability of a diversified portfolio by testing absolute convergence of returns.
```python
def absolute_convergence(returns):
    """
    Test if the sum of absolute returns converges.
    """
    abs_sum = np.sum(np.abs(returns))
    return abs_sum

# Example: Portfolio returns
portfolio_returns = [0.03, -0.02, 0.01, -0.005, 0.02]
print("Absolute Convergence:", absolute_convergence(portfolio_returns))
```
