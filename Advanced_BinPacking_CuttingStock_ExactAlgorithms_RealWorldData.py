### 1. **Mathematical Model for Bin Packing using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) with Realistic Data**
   *This advanced MILP-based model minimizes the number of bins while using synthetic data, ensuring the solution's real-world applicability.*
   ```python
   from pulp import LpProblem, LpMinimize, LpVariable, lpSum, value
   import random

   # Generating synthetic data for bin packing
   def generate_synthetic_data(num_items, max_item_size, bin_capacity):
       return [random.randint(1, max_item_size) for _ in range(num_items)], bin_capacity

   def advanced_bin_packing(num_items, max_item_size, bin_capacity):
       items, bin_capacity = generate_synthetic_data(num_items, max_item_size, bin_capacity)
       prob = LpProblem("Advanced_Bin_Packing", LpMinimize)
       num_bins = num_items  # Max bins = number of items (worst case)

       # Variables: x_ij = 1 if item i is in bin j, y_j = 1 if bin j is used
       x = LpVariable.dicts("x", (range(num_items), range(num_bins)), 0, 1, cat='Binary')
       y = LpVariable.dicts("y", range(num_bins), 0, 1, cat='Binary')

       # Objective: minimize number of bins used
       prob += lpSum(y[j] for j in range(num_bins))

       # Constraints: each item must be packed in exactly one bin
       for i in range(num_items):
           prob += lpSum(x[i][j] for j in range(num_bins)) == 1

       # Bin capacity constraints
       for j in range(num_bins):
           prob += lpSum(x[i][j] * items[i] for i in range(num_items)) <= bin_capacity * y[j]

       # Solve and return solution
       prob.solve()
       return [value(y[j]) for j in range(num_bins)], items

   # Example usage with realistic synthetic data
   bins_used, items = advanced_bin_packing(num_items=100, max_item_size=50, bin_capacity=100)
