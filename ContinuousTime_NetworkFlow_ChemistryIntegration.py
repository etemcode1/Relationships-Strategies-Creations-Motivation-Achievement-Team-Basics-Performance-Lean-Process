4. **Diffusion-Based Load Balancing**: Evenly distributes loads through a diffusion model, enhancing stability and resilience.
5. **Rate Constraints for Continuous Flow**: Limits flow based on reaction kinetics, maintaining system integrity under high demand.
6. **Adaptive Flow with Feedback**: Emulates catalytic feedback, adjusting flow dynamically to reach optimal load balancing.
7. **Resource Allocation with Flow Constraints**: Allocates resources based on equilibrium concepts, improving network efficiency.
8. **Cyclic Flow Patterns**: Models oscillatory flows, enabling periodic adjustments to optimize network stability.
9. **Gradient Descent Load Balancing**: Applies gradient-based load balancing to stabilize the network, analogous to buffering in pH.
