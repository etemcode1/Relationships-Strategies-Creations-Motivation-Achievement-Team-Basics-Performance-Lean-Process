Here are **5 deeper and more advanced quantum physics network examples**, expanding on the previous concepts and pushing further into the intricacies of supply chain optimization, with more sophisticated quantum mechanisms.

### 1. **Quantum Tensor Networks for Multilayered Supply Chain Mapping**

This example uses tensor networks to model a complex, multilayered supply chain system with multiple suppliers and distribution hubs.

```python
import numpy as np
import quimb as qu
import quimb.tensor as qtn

# Create a tensor network for a multilayered supply chain
nodes = ['supplier1', 'supplier2', 'hub1', 'hub2', 'distribution1', 'distribution2']
tn = qtn.TensorNetwork([])

# Add tensors (nodes) to the network
for node in nodes:
    tensor = qu.rand_tensor([2, 2], dtype='complex128')
    tn.add_tensor(tensor, name=node)

# Link nodes to represent the supply chain connections
tn.contract_between('supplier1', 'hub1')
tn.contract_between('supplier2', 'hub2')
tn.contract_between('hub1', 'distribution1')
tn.contract_between('hub2', 'distribution2')

# Perform a contraction to simulate the flow of goods
result = tn.contract()
print("Multilayered Supply Chain Simulation Result:", result)
```

### 2. **Quantum Monte Carlo for Probabilistic Supply Chain Forecasting**

This example leverages Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to perform probabilistic demand forecasting, allowing for more flexible supply chain planning.

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

# Define a function for a Quantum Monte Carlo step
def quantum_monte_carlo_step():
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.measure_all()
    return qc

# Simulate the Quantum Monte Carlo process for supply chain forecasting
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
forecasts = []

# Simulate multiple steps for probabilistic forecasting
for _ in range(100):
    qc = quantum_monte_carlo_step()
    job = execute(qc, backend, shots=1)
    result = job.result().get_counts()
    forecasts.append(result)

# Aggregate and analyze results
probabilities = np.mean([list(forecast.values())[0] for forecast in forecasts])
print("Quantum Monte Carlo Supply Chain Forecasting Probability:", probabilities)
```

### 3. **Quantum Annealing for Real-Time Route Optimization**

This example deepens the quantum annealing approach to include real-time adjustments in supply chain logistics, dynamically optimizing delivery routes.

```python
import dimod
from dwave.system import EmbeddingComposite, DWaveSampler

# Define the BQM (Binary Quadratic Model) for real-time route optimization
bqm = dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel({'route1': -1, 'route2': -1, 'route3': -1},
                                 {('route1', 'route2'): 2, ('route1', 'route3'): 3}, 0, dimod.BINARY)

# Use D-Wave's quantum annealer to optimize
sampler = EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler())
sampleset = sampler.sample(bqm, num_reads=100)

# Display the results
print("Optimal Route:", sampleset.first.sample)
```

### 4. **Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Supply Chain Decision Making**

This example integrates quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) into supply chain decision-making to optimize the flow of goods dynamically.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
import numpy as np

# Define the Q-learning parameters
alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate
gamma = 0.9  # Discount factor
epsilon = 0.1  # Exploration-exploitation trade-off

# Define a simple Q-table for supply chain states and actions
Q_table = np.zeros((5, 2))  # 5 states, 2 possible actions

# Quantum circuit to update the Q-values based on experience
def quantum_update(state, action):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc.h(state)
    qc.cx(state, action)
    return qc

# Simulate a learning episode
state = 0  # Initial state
for _ in range(100):
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:  # Explore
        action = np.random.choice([0, 1])
    else:  # Exploit
        action = np.argmax(Q_table[state])

    qc = quantum_update(state, action)
    backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
    result = execute(qc, backend).result().get_counts()

    # Update Q-table based on result (quantum feedback)
    reward = np.random.rand()  # Simulated reward
    Q_table[state, action] = Q_table[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q_table[state]) - Q_table[state, action])

print("Updated Q-table after Quantum Reinforcement Learning:", Q_table)
```

### 5. **Quantum Supply Chain Cryptography with Shorâ€™s Algorithm for Factorization**

This example uses Shor's algorithm to ensure secure communications in the supply chain by encrypting sensitive data and breaking large composite numbers for cryptographic analysis.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, transpile
from qiskit.algorithms import Shor

# Use Shor's algorithm to factor a composite number (for cryptography)
N = 15  # Example composite number
shor = Shor()
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
result = shor.factor(N, backend)

# Display the factorization result (keys for secure encryption)
print("Shor's Algorithm Factors for Secure Supply Chain Communication:", result)
```
