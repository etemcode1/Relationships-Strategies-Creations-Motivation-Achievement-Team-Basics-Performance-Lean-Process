Here are seven advanced code examples focused on identifying, mitigating, and managing risks related to predictable, programmable, and unpredictable harm in AI/ML models:

### 1. **Predictable Harm Detection with SHAP Explanations**
   - Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to detect predictable harmful outcomes by explaining model decisions.
   - **Use case**: Financial models that predict loan defaults, identifying high-risk predictions.
   - **Application**: Enhances transparency in AI systems and provides a risk-based decision-making approach.
   ```python
   import shap

   # Assuming `model` and `X_train` are predefined
   explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
   shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_train)

   # Identify high-risk predictions for further inspection
   harmful_predictions = X_train[shap_values > threshold]
   ```

### 2. **Programmable Harm Mitigation through Adversarial Training**
   - Implement adversarial training to make models more resilient to programmable harm like adversarial attacks.
   - **Use case**: Image classification systems, where attackers can fool models by slightly altering inputs.
   - **Application**: Secure AI systems by reducing the chance of exploitation via adversarial perturbations.
   ```python
   from adversarial_attacks import FastGradientMethod
   # Generate adversarial examples
   attack = FastGradientMethod(model)
   adversarial_examples = attack.generate(X_train)

   # Train on a mixture of normal and adversarial examples
   model.fit([X_train, adversarial_examples], y_train)
   ```

### 3. **Unpredictable Harm Detection Using Anomaly Detection**
   - Use anomaly detection techniques like Isolation Forest to capture unpredictable harm that is not seen during model training.
   - **Use case**: Detecting unexpected system behavior or data anomalies in medical diagnosis models.
   - **Application**: Real-time alert systems for detecting unusual and potentially harmful behavior.
   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
   # Fit the model
   isolation_forest = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
   isolation_forest.fit(X_train)

   # Detect unpredictable harmful outcomes
   anomalies = isolation_forest.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 4. **Bias Mitigation Using Fairness Constraints**
   - Implement fairness-aware learning algorithms to prevent bias and harm due to skewed model training data.
   - **Use case**: Preventing racial or gender bias in hiring algorithms.
   - **Application**: Ensures AI systems treat sensitive groups fairly, avoiding legal risks and ethical issues.
   ```python
   from aif360.algorithms.postprocessing import RejectOptionClassification
   # Train model with fairness constraints
   fair_model = RejectOptionClassification(sensitive_attr='gender')
   fair_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

   # Mitigate harm by ensuring unbiased predictions
   fair_predictions = fair_model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 5. **Risk Mitigation through Model Ensemble for Uncertainty Estimation**
   - Build ensemble models to estimate prediction uncertainty and mitigate potential harm by abstaining in uncertain cases.
   - **Use case**: Medical diagnostic models where uncertain predictions could lead to severe harm.
   - **Application**: Increased reliability and robustness in high-risk fields like healthcare.
   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier
   # Create an ensemble of models
   ensemble = VotingClassifier(estimators=[('clf1', model1), ('clf2', model2)], voting='soft')
   ensemble.fit(X_train, y_train)

   # Mitigate risk by abstaining on uncertain predictions
   predictions = ensemble.predict(X_test)
   uncertainty = ensemble.predict_proba(X_test).max(axis=1)
   safe_predictions = predictions[uncertainty > threshold]
   ```

### 6. **Mitigating Unpredictable Harm with Continual Learning**
   - Implement continual learning to mitigate harm caused by model degradation over time (concept drift).
   - **Use case**: Fraud detection models that need to adapt to evolving attack patterns.
   - **Application**: Keeps AI systems relevant and effective over time, preventing unpredictable failures.
   ```python
   from continual_learning import ContinualLearner
   # Assuming `model` and `new_data` are predefined
   learner = ContinualLearner(model)
   learner.update(new_data)

   # Keep track of model drift to prevent unpredictable harm
   model_drift = learner.detect_drift()
   ```

### 7. **Scenario Planning for Harm Prevention Using Monte Carlo Simulations**
   - Use Monte Carlo simulations to predict and prevent harm in different operational scenarios.
   - **Use case**: AI-driven financial systems predicting stock market fluctuations.
   - **Application**: Helps in stress-testing models against worst-case scenarios, ensuring robust and safe operations.
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   # Simulate multiple scenarios for predicting harm
   def monte_carlo_simulation(model, X_test, n_simulations=1000):
       simulations = []
       for _ in range(n_simulations):
           perturbed_X = X_test + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, X_test.shape)
           simulations.append(model.predict(perturbed_X))
       return np.mean(simulations, axis=0)

   # Use the simulation to predict potential harmful outcomes
   harm_predictions = monte_carlo_simulation(model, X_test)
   ```
