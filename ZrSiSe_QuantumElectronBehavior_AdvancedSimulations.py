### 1. **Band Structure Calculation**

This script calculates the band structure of ZrSiSe using the tight-binding model to simulate the electron energy dispersions.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define parameters for ZrSiSe (simplified for illustration)
t1 = 1.0  # hopping term
k_points = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 100)

# Define the band structure function for ZrSiSe
def band_structure(k):
    return 2 * t1 * (1 - np.cos(k))  # Example band structure equation

# Calculate the energy bands
energies = [band_structure(k) for k in k_points]

# Plot the band structure
plt.plot(k_points, energies, label='ZrSiSe Band Structure')
plt.xlabel("k")
plt.ylabel("Energy (E)")
plt.title("Band Structure of ZrSiSe")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### **Purpose**:
This example directly computes and visualizes the band structure, a key feature of electron behavior in ZrSiSe.

### 2. **Density of States (DOS) Calculation**

This script calculates the Density of States (DOS), which reflects the number of electronic states at each energy level.

```python
from scipy import integrate

# Example DOS function for ZrSiSe (simplified for illustration)
def dos(E, t1):
    return np.sqrt(E) / (2 * np.pi * t1)

# Energy range
E_range = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)

# Calculate DOS
dos_values = [dos(E, t1) for E in E_range]

# Plot DOS
plt.plot(E_range, dos_values, label="DOS of ZrSiSe")
plt.xlabel("Energy (E)")
plt.ylabel("DOS")
plt.title("Density of States of ZrSiSe")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### **Purpose**:
This code calculates and visualizes the DOS, crucial for understanding how electrons are distributed in ZrSiSe.

### 3. **Electron Scattering Simulation**

Simulates electron scattering events, an essential process in determining the electrical properties of quantum metals.

```python
import random

# Constants
scatter_prob = 0.1  # Probability of scattering
num_electrons = 1000  # Number of electrons
steps = 1000  # Time steps for simulation

# Function to simulate scattering
def simulate_scattering(scatter_prob, num_electrons, steps):
    positions = np.zeros(num_electrons)
    
    for step in range(steps):
        for i in range(num_electrons):
            if random.random() < scatter_prob:
                positions[i] += random.choice([-1, 1])  # Scattering causes random movement
    
    return positions

# Run simulation
final_positions = simulate_scattering(scatter_prob, num_electrons, steps)

# Plot final positions histogram
plt.hist(final_positions, bins=50, density=True, label='Electron Distribution after Scattering')
plt.xlabel("Position")
plt.ylabel("Probability Density")
plt.title("Electron Scattering in ZrSiSe")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### **Purpose**:
This simulates how electrons scatter, affecting conductivity and electron mobility in ZrSiSe.

### 4. **Quantum Conductance Calculation**

Calculates quantum conductance, which is important in materials like ZrSiSe with topologically protected states.

```python
# Quantum of conductance (e^2/h)
e = 1.6e-19  # charge of electron (C)
h = 6.63e-34  # Planck's constant (J*s)
G0 = e**2 / h  # quantum of conductance

# Function to calculate conductance in ZrSiSe
def conductance(num_channels):
    return num_channels * G0

# Example: Calculate conductance for 4 channels
num_channels = 4
G = conductance(num_channels)

print(f"Quantum Conductance for {num_channels} channels in ZrSiSe: {G:.3e} S")
```

### **Purpose**:
This example computes the quantum conductance, revealing how ZrSiSe might exhibit quantized conductance due to its electronic structure.

### 5. **Electron Mobility Calculation**

Calculates the electron mobility in ZrSiSe based on a simplified scattering time model.

```python
# Constants for mobility calculation
m_eff = 9.11e-31  # Effective electron mass (kg)
charge = 1.6e-19  # Charge of electron (C)
scattering_time = 1e-14  # Scattering time (s)

# Function to calculate electron mobility
def electron_mobility(m_eff, scattering_time, charge):
    return (charge * scattering_time) / m_eff

# Calculate mobility
mobility = electron_mobility(m_eff, scattering_time, charge)
print(f"Electron Mobility in ZrSiSe: {mobility:.3e} m^2/(VÂ·s)")
```

### **Purpose**:
This calculates electron mobility, key for understanding the transport properties of ZrSiSe.
