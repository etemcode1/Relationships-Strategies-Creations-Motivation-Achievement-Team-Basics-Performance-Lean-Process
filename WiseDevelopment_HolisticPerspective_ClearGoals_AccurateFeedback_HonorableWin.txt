---

### **Features**  

1. **Add or Update Teams**  
   - Uses `update()` to handle batch updates to team performance data.

2. **Get Team Performance**  
   - Leverages `get()` to retrieve scores safely, avoiding errors for missing keys.

3. **Remove Teams**  
   - Utilizes `pop()` and `popitem()` for targeted and last-inserted removals.

4. **Display Data**  
   - Uses `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()` for structured access to dictionary content.

5. **Set Default**  
   - Implements `setdefault()` for adding default values without overwriting existing ones.

6. **Clear Data**  
   - Employs `clear()` to reset the dictionary for reuse.

7. **Copy and Clone**  
   - Uses `copy()` to create safe copies of the dictionary for independent operations.

8. **Initialize with Default Values**  
   - Utilizes `fromkeys()` to quickly create dictionaries with uniform default values.

---

### **How It Works**  

- The function **`manage_team_performance`** processes a list of actions to manipulate the team performance dictionary dynamically.  
- It supports a wide range of operations, making it suitable for managing **distributed teams, scaling operations, and real-time analytics**.  
- The code is robust and handles both successful and unsuccessful operations gracefully, printing informative feedback.

---

### **Output Example**  

```
Performance of Team A: 85
Performance of Team C: 90
Removed Team B: 78
All teams: ['Team A', 'Team C']
All performance scores: [85, 90]
All team data: [('Team A', 85), ('Team C', 90)]
Last removed team: ('Team D', 95)
Copied team data: {'Team A': 85, 'Team C': 90}
All team data cleared.
New teams initialized: {'Team E': 50, 'Team F': 50}

Final Team Performance Data:
{}

### **Features and Explanation**

1. **Random Permutation**  
   - Generates a random permutation of an array using `np.random.permutation`.  
   - Example: Randomly shuffle the order of elements in a list of numbers.  

2. **Normal Distribution**  
   - Uses `np.random.normal` for creating data with a normal distribution.  
   - Practical Application: Analyzing phenomena like test scores or heights.

3. **Binomial Distribution**  
   - Simulates a series of experiments with two outcomes using `scipy.stats.binom`.  
   - Example: Success or failure in 10 coin flips.

4. **Poisson Distribution**  
   - Models events occurring at a constant average rate, using `scipy.stats.poisson`.  
   - Example: Predicting the number of customer arrivals per hour.

5. **Uniform Distribution**  
   - Generates evenly distributed random data using `scipy.stats.uniform`.  
   - Application: Sampling random values with equal probability across a range.

6. **Logistic Distribution**  
   - Models sigmoid growth data using `scipy.stats.logistic`.  
   - Example: Logistic regression-related use cases.
