### **2. Mesoscopic Systems and Quantum Optical Effects**

Mesoscopic systems are physical systems that lie between microscopic (quantum) and macroscopic scales. Coherent and collective optical effects in these systems can influence signal transmission, decision-making frameworks, and even learning paradigms by harnessing quantum coherence and entanglement.

#### **Example 1: Modeling Quantum Coherence in Decision-Making**  
Simulates BDNF's impact on cognitive flexibility using quantum states.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>

using namespace std;
const double hbar = 1.0545718e-34;  // Planck's constant

void simulate_brain_state(double coherence, double energy_level) {
    complex<double> quantum_state = polar(1.0, coherence * energy_level / hbar);
    cout << "Quantum State: " << quantum_state << endl;
}

int main() {
    double coherence = 0.8;  // High coherence level
    double energy_level = 1.5;  // Arbitrary energy value
    simulate_brain_state(coherence, energy_level);
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Example 2: Predictive Learning in Mesoscopic Networks (Python)**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import expm

def quantum_learning(state, learning_rate):
    hamiltonian = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])
    evolution = expm(-1j * learning_rate * hamiltonian)
    return np.dot(evolution, state)

state = np.array([1, 0])
new_state = quantum_learning(state, 0.05)
print(f"Updated Quantum State: {new_state}")
```
