### **1. Complex-Valued Neural Network Initialization**
   *This code initializes a complex-valued neural network by defining weights and biases using random complex numbers, essential for capturing complex patterns in data. The initialization employs a method that ensures the stability of the training process, which is crucial for convergence in networks operating in complex domains.*
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   def initialize_complex_weights(input_size, hidden_size):
       # Initialize real and imaginary components from a Gaussian distribution
       real_weights = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size) * np.sqrt(2. / (input_size + hidden_size))
       imag_weights = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size) * np.sqrt(2. / (input_size + hidden_size))
       return real_weights + 1j * imag_weights

   input_size = 50
   hidden_size = 100
   complex_weights = initialize_complex_weights(input_size, hidden_size)
   print(f"Initialized complex weights shape: {complex_weights.shape}")
   ```
   *Brilliant Reasoning:* By employing a **He initialization** method for both the real and imaginary parts of the weights, the initialization strategy maintains a consistent variance across layers, which is critical in preventing vanishing or exploding gradients during the early stages of training. This sophisticated initialization fosters the emergence of rich feature representations, particularly in high-dimensional data spaces where complex patterns are prevalent.
   *Economic Success:* The optimized initialization process is particularly advantageous in fields such as telecommunications and signal processing, where capturing the intricate relationships in complex-valued data can lead to enhanced model performance and predictive accuracy, translating to better resource utilization and cost savings.

### **2. Forward Propagation in Complex-Valued Neural Networks**
   *An implementation of forward propagation for complex-valued neural networks, allowing the computation of outputs given complex inputs and weights. The forward pass incorporates an activation function that respects the complex nature of the data, ensuring that the outputs remain in the complex domain.*
   ```python
   def complex_forward_propagation(X, W):
       # Linear transformation followed by a non-linear activation function
       return np.tanh(X.dot(W))  # Use hyperbolic tangent for non-linearity

   # Example input and weights
   X = np.random.randn(100, 50) + 1j * np.random.randn(100, 50)  # 100 samples, complex input
   complex_outputs = complex_forward_propagation(X, complex_weights)
   print(f"Complex outputs shape: {complex_outputs.shape}")
   ```
   *Brilliant Reasoning:* The use of the **tanh** activation function in the forward propagation allows for the compression of output values to the range \([-1, 1]\), effectively controlling the growth of activations. This characteristic is vital in complex domains where large values can lead to instability, ensuring that the network can learn effectively without diverging. Furthermore, the linear transformation preserves the inherent structure of complex inputs, which is paramount for capturing the relationships between different features in complex datasets.

       # Compute Mean Squared Error for both real and imaginary parts
       return np.mean(np.abs(y_true - y_pred)**2)

   # Example with synthetic data
   y_true = np.random.randn(100) + 1j * np.random.randn(100)  # synthetic target
   loss = complex_loss_function(y_true, complex_outputs)
   print(f"Complex loss value: {loss}")
   ```

       # Calculate the gradient of the loss with respect to predictions
       error = y_pred - y_true
       dW = (X.T.conj() * error) / len(y_true)  # Gradient calculation with complex conjugate
       W -= learning_rate * dW  # Update the weights using the computed gradients
