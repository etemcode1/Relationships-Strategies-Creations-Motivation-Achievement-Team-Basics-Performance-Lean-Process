### Advanced Code Examples

#### 1. **Task Planning with Natural Language Understanding**

This example parses natural language commands and generates structured task plans, ensuring clarity and relevance to daily objectives.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
import numpy as np

# Sample training data representing more realistic tasks
training_data = [
    ("Please clean the kitchen before the guests arrive.", "clean"),
    ("Remember to take out the trash by 6 PM.", "clean"),
    ("Make a fresh pot of coffee for the meeting at 9 AM.", "prepare"),
    ("Set the dining table for six people before dinner.", "prepare"),
    ("Walk the dog in the evening to keep him healthy.", "exercise"),
    ("Feed the cat twice a day to maintain her health.", "care")
]

# Prepare data
X_train, y_train = zip(*training_data)
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_train_counts = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)

# Train model
classifier = MultinomialNB()
classifier.fit(X_train_counts, y_train)

def recognize_intent(command):
    """Recognize intent from a command and provide context-aware responses."""
    command_counts = vectorizer.transform([command])
    intent = classifier.predict(command_counts)[0]
    response = f"The task '{command}' has been classified as '{intent}'."
    return intent, response

# Example usage
command = "Please clean the kitchen before the guests arrive."
intent, response = recognize_intent(command)
print(f"Recognized Intent: {intent}\nResponse: {response}")
```

#### 2. **Task Scheduling for Daily Goals**

This enhanced example schedules tasks based on their priorities, deadlines, and dependencies, ensuring that daily and long-term goals are aligned.

```python
import datetime

class Task:
    def __init__(self, name, deadline, priority, dependencies=None):
        self.name = name
        self.deadline = deadline
        self.priority = priority
        self.dependencies = dependencies or []

def schedule_tasks(tasks):
    """Schedule tasks based on priority, deadline, and dependencies."""
    tasks.sort(key=lambda x: (x.deadline, -x.priority))
    schedule = []

    for task in tasks:
        if all(dep in [t.name for t in schedule] for dep in task.dependencies):
            schedule.append(task)
    
    return [(task.name, task.deadline) for task in schedule]

# Example usage
tasks = [
    Task("Finalize project report", datetime.datetime(2024, 10, 10, 17, 0), priority=1),
    Task("Review team presentations", datetime.datetime(2024, 10, 11, 9, 0), priority=2),
    Task("Team meeting to discuss project timeline", datetime.datetime(2024, 10, 10, 10, 0), priority=3, dependencies=["Finalize project report"]),
    Task("Send feedback to team members", datetime.datetime(2024, 10, 10, 12, 0), priority=2, dependencies=["Review team presentations"])
]

scheduled_tasks = schedule_tasks(tasks)
print("Scheduled Tasks:")
for task in scheduled_tasks:
    print(f"Task: {task[0]}, Deadline: {task[1].strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}")
```

#### 3. **Collaborative Communication with Language Models**

This example utilizes a pre-trained language model for context-aware communication, enhancing the understanding of team dynamics.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained language model for question answering
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering")

def ask_question(context, question):
    """Ask a question based on the provided context, ensuring relevance to ongoing tasks."""
    result = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)
    return result['answer'] if result['score'] > 0.5 else "I'm not sure, let me check with the team."

# Example usage
context = (
    "In our last meeting, we discussed the project timeline and the need to finalize the report "
    "by Thursday. Additionally, it was emphasized that team members should send their presentations "
    "for review by the end of the day."
)
question = "What is the deadline for finalizing the report?"
answer = ask_question(context, question)
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

#### 4. **Action Execution and Robotics Control**

This enhanced example illustrates how to execute complex actions while maintaining feedback loops for continuous improvement.

```python
class Robot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = "idle"
        self.task_history = []

    def execute_command(self, command):
        """Execute a command on the robot while logging actions for feedback."""
        actions = {
            "clean": "Cleaning the kitchen and living room...",
            "prepare": "Preparing the coffee and snacks...",
            "exercise": "Walking the dog in the park for 30 minutes..."
        }
        if command in actions:
            self.state = command
            self.task_history.append(command)
            print(actions[command])
        else:
            print("Unknown command! Please specify a valid task.")

# Example usage
robot = Robot()
robot.execute_command("clean")
robot.execute_command("prepare")
robot.execute_command("exercise")
```

#### 5. **Feedback Collection for Continuous Improvement**

This example introduces a feedback system that ensures task performance is evaluated based on specific metrics and actionable insights.

```python
class FeedbackSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.feedback_list = []

    def collect_feedback(self, task_name, feedback, rating):
        """Collect feedback on a completed task along with performance rating."""
        self.feedback_list.append((task_name, feedback, rating))
        print(f"Feedback received for {task_name}: {feedback} (Rating: {rating}/5)")

    def display_feedback(self):
        """Display all collected feedback for performance review."""
        for task, feedback, rating in self.feedback_list:
            print(f"Task: {task}, Feedback: {feedback}, Rating: {rating}/5")

# Example usage
feedback_system = FeedbackSystem()
feedback_system.collect_feedback("clean the kitchen", "Thoroughly done, the kitchen is spotless.", 5)
feedback_system.collect_feedback("make coffee", "It was too strong for my taste.", 3)
feedback_system.display_feedback()
```

#### 6. **Long-Term Goal Tracking**

This advanced example integrates progress tracking and long-term goal management, providing a more structured approach to personal and team objectives.

```python
class Goal:
    def __init__(self, name, target_date):
        self.name = name
        self.target_date = target_date
        self.progress = 0

    def update_progress(self, progress):
        """Update the progress of the goal and provide contextual feedback."""
        if 0 <= progress <= 100:
            self.progress = progress
            print(f"Updated progress for '{self.name}': {self.progress}%.")
        else:
            print("Invalid progress value. Must be between 0 and 100.")

    def is_achieved(self):
        """Check if the goal has been achieved."""
        return self.progress >= 100

# Example usage
goal = Goal("Complete project by end of month", datetime.datetime(2024, 10, 31))
goal.update_progress(75)
print(f"Is the goal '{goal.name}' achieved? {'Yes' if goal.is_achieved() else 'No'}")
```

#### 7. **Multi-Agent Coordination**

This refined example emphasizes coordination among agents to effectively share tasks and communicate status updates, facilitating teamwork.

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def communicate(self, message):
        """Communicate status and updates to other agents."""
        print(f"{self.name}: {message}")

def coordinate_agents(agents, task):
    """Coordinate agents to perform a task collaboratively."""
    for agent in agents:
        agent.communicate(f"Ready to start the task '{task}'!")

# Example usage
agents = [Agent("Robot 1"), Agent("Robot 2"), Agent("Robot 3")]
task_name = "clean the office space"
coordinate_agents(agents, task_name)
```

### Summary

These enhanced examples showcase how a large language model-based collaborative robot system can effectively assist in daily tasks while ensuring alignment with deeper personal and team goals. Each code snippet is designed to promote clear communication, structured task management, and effective feedback mechanisms, fostering a productive environment that encourages continuous improvement and collaboration. By employing advanced techniques in natural language processing, task scheduling, and agent coordination, the system can significantly enhance team performance and individual success.
